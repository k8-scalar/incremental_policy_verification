eerst microsegmentation tools bekeken...
algemene papers over kubernetes security, worst practices...
opgesplits over nuttigheid

Algemene topics bekeken:
tools -> authentication & authorization ->  impersonation -
> overworked, maar gat in kubernetes?

momenteel onderzoek naar detection of problematic policies in mind. 
maar afhankelijk van segmentation tools natuurlijk...

research of literatuur paper?

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Grashopper paper and references. 
Microsegmentation papers are border of research, related but not necessary
GAP analysis, understand what state of the art supports
what do the tools do, what do they miss
Kano matrix, which machines.
OpenStack API, Kubernetes API and Grashopper

What are the current capablities of the microsegmentation
DO THE MATRIX
Distrinet-cloud account: Send email with R-number to 
	deploy kubernetes on there instead of openstack
	openstack will be reworked so it might be asolete 
	minicube for initial research since it is single node, so Openstack will be needed
	run nodes as docker containers: search for it.

ADD them to Gitlab. 

20 november: slide of problem, state of the art, 20 mins ppt, start working on that.
what do you mean on verifying the policies, than see if tools can solve these questions? If not or yes follow in.

\The main problem is.... Existing state-of-the-art 14,21,25 (in paper)
