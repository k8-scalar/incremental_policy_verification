Dear LinkedIn network,

As I approach the culmination of my studies in Applied Computer Science at UCLL and KUL, I am excited to share that I'm in the final stages of (hopefully ;) ) completing my thesis focused on security within the Kubernetes cloud stack.

My passion for cloud architecture, DevOps, and code development has been a driving force throughout my academic journey, and I am looking forward to the start of my professional career. Ofcourse that is the (not-so) hidden reason I am writing this message to you all.

I am now eagerly seeking a full-time, fully remote role for which I would be available starting this January and am open to a training period in the first half of 2024. I hope to find a job that allows me to contribute my expertise whilst learning more as I find my way through the field of computer science.
Beyond my academic pursuits, I am drawn to roles that allow me to apply my knowledge while embracing the thrill of exploring diverse regions across Europe.

If my background and aspirations resonate with your organization or if you'd like to connect to discuss potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for being a part of my professional journey.

Warm regards,
Jasper
