Minikube -> only 1 node so DONT use
Dnet cluster needed!!!!

monitoring SG/VM's is hard -> might leave that -> only focus on add/delete newpod and 

inspector.py on gitlab: implementations needed
k8s-watch uses namespace test!

k8s-watch watches cluster, puts changes into data folder
inspector watches data folder and does the algorithm



what if many events happen at the same time? does the algorithm work fast enough to keep up? Testable?
vm matrix uses all VMs, not only ones with kubernetes node (but has blacklist)
sorting of VMs in the VM matrix (2 is in last position now).

(step 5 can be done simultaneously)
1. DNET ACCESS
2. SET UP K8S SETUP (FEW VMS, POLICIES, CONTAINERS...) (think about namespace test) (use kubeadm to install kubernetes on master and all nodes) (1 master, multiple nodes)
(calico ebpf as CNI?)
3. SSH into master, setup scripts
4. get K8s-watcher en inspector working (first jasper.sh) (will create data and src_dir folder) (kubctl apply -f testpod.yml) (src_dir needs manual cleaning once in a while)
5. Implementation of the algorithm!

(deactivate command to stop shell)
