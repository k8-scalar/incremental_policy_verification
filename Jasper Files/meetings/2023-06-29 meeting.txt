Grashopper: Use Kano to check for bad networkpolicies, uses NP as base to create security group rules in line with NP

My thesis: Use kano to check for bad NP and check with Security group rules whether or not they are contradicting.


Grasshopper assumes cluster admin trust NP, which is wrong since tenants can apply NP
I dont take a base truth, just assume conflicts and give the origins

Sheduling doesnt take into account that SG info and NP can be defined incrementally, dynamically.
e.g running applications, we want to reschedule, but first make sure it is allowed.

already deployed pods are scheduled, new policies need to be checked to not contradict placements
also pre-check of new placements.

compute desired from kano.
compare desired with other.

Main questions should be focussed on what cant be solved already! sheduling can usually prevent, but new policies for existing pods can cause new conflicts.

1 problem: what is the dafult resolution strategy? What is the base truth. 
Maybe have the option to select the base truth: SG or NP? He advises NOT to write about it.only what I implement myself. 

Or find the pods that are unable to send or receive, delete them, so they reschedule and replace correctly.
We could simply node-to-pod affinity constraints e.g.
Provide a simple very-cluster specific solution. 
I NEED A RESOLUTION STEP TO BE COMPLETE.
