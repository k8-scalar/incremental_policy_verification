Superclusters and namespace permissions for private are not aligned
Some solutions exist, by microsegmentation tools (Cisco, VMWare, Calico, Alto)-> Literature

1. try understanding current prototypes
2. define a Delta (what are you going to add)
3. is there a tool to dynamically detect inconsistencies. (take into account pod creations on VM's and intercommunication between VM's, so it may change instantly)
4. Be notfied about problematic pod deployments and new network  policies that create conflicts

generate VM to VM matrix that encodes inter-VM communications by network policies and pod deployments locations (to see who should be able to send to eachother)
compare to matrix that represent actual VM communication status
simulate this with a nr of matrix figurations that represent popular settings (e.g. public and private cloud)

openstack = pioneer of kubernetes. CS department has openstack with kubernetes on
TIME COMPLEXITY OF THE SOLUTION IS IMPORTANT

out of scope: why are the settings wrong and possible resolves

KANO not needed if we assume policies are valid



HOW AND WHO
- be independent, but 2-weekly meetings, mails for unsolvable problems
- Gerald = Phd student works with Erikson in Stockholm, not in Leuven till April, but in leuven between december and januari
- Gerald or Gerry main coach, to be decided.
- 3rd promotor will be in presentations, but not 




impersonation of authorisation???

look into known kubernetes risks that have been resolved
Try some out yourself?
