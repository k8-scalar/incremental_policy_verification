\chapter{Preface}                                 \label{ch:preface}
This thesis marks the end of a long academic journey that would not have been possible without the continuous support of all the people around me. I would like to take some time to dedicate this section to them.

First of all I would like to thank all my promotors and mentor for their support and guidance throughout this journey. Specifically, I would like to thank Professor E. Truyen for his understanding, patience and continuous aid by applying his expertise every step of the way. Naturally I would like to specifically thank my mentor G. Budigiri as well, who was an immense help in finding my way around the many pitfalls of this thesis and gladly answered all my questions no matter how big or small.

None of this would have been possible without my parents who supported me and gave me the opportunities to prove myself in my academic career. Throughout my academic journey, there were countless times when the road seemed too daunting or even impossible, but each time I could rely on my friends and family to have my back and help me some steps further along the path. Without them, this journey would not have been possible and I owe them all my immense gratitude.
Finally, I would like to thank my girlfriend for always believing in me, even when I did not believe in myself and for standing by my side every step of the way.
